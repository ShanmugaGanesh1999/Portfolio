# Shanmuga Ganesh's Portfolio

This project is my personal portfolio website built with React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
This is useful for running and developing tests for the components.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is then ready to be deployed!

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the React components and pages
- `public/`: Contains the public assets and the main `index.html` file
- `components/`: Reusable React components used throughout the app
