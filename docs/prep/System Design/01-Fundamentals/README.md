## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **System Design is about trade-offs** - There's no perfect solution
2. **Abstractions hide complexity** - Learn to use them effectively
3. **Consistency and availability are at odds** - CAP theorem
4. **Failures are inevitable** - Design for graceful degradation
5. **Start simple, scale when needed** - Premature optimization is the enemy
