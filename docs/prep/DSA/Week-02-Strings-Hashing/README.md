## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- [ ] Manipulate strings efficiently in Python
- [ ] Implement a hash map from scratch
- [ ] Solve character frequency problems
- [ ] Recognize and solve anagram problems
- [ ] Use the "Knowing What to Track" pattern

---

## 📖 Key Concepts

### 1. String Immutability
Strings in Python are immutable - modifications create new strings.

### 2. Hash Map Operations
- Get/Set: O(1) average
- Delete: O(1) average
- Contains: O(1) average

### 3. Common String Patterns
- Two Pointers for palindrome
- Sliding Window for substrings
- Hash Map for character counting
