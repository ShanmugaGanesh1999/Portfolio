## 🎯 Pattern Types

### 1. Fixed Size Window
Window size is given (k elements).
```
[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
 └──k=3──┘
```

### 2. Variable Size - Longest
Find longest window satisfying condition.
```
[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
 └────expand────→
```

### 3. Variable Size - Shortest
Find shortest window satisfying condition.
```
[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
    ←──shrink──┘
```
