## 🚀 Interview Day Tips

1. **Clarify requirements** before coding
2. **Think out loud** - explain your approach
3. **Start with brute force**, then optimize
4. **Test with examples** (edge cases!)
5. **Analyze complexity** proactively

---

## 📖 Recommended Practice Order

After completing this roadmap:

1. **LeetCode Blind 75** - Essential problems
2. **NeetCode 150** - Extended list
3. **Company-specific** - Focus on target companies
4. **Weekly contests** - Time pressure practice
