3. Fast & Slow Pointers   → Week 4
4. Modified Binary Search → Week 7
5. Cyclic Sort            → Week 1
6. In-place Linked List   → Week 4
7. Merge Intervals        → Week 8
8. Tree BFS/DFS           → Week 9

## 🎓 Tips for Success

### 1. **Understand Before Memorizing**
Don't memorize solutions. Understand the intuition behind each pattern.

### 2. **Code Without IDE Help First**
Practice writing code on paper or whiteboard to simulate interview conditions.

### 3. **Explain Your Thinking**
Practice explaining your approach out loud as you solve problems.

### 4. **Time Yourself**
Aim to solve:
- Easy: 10-15 minutes
- Medium: 20-30 minutes
- Hard: 40-45 minutes

### 5. **Review Mistakes**
Keep a log of problems you struggled with and revisit them weekly.
